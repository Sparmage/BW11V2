# What it does.
This batch is for users who don't want to go digging in the windows folders. What this batch does is it takes the compatability dll from windows 20H2 and replaces the one Windows Update uses. As of 9/9/21 it should work.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65756037/132767609-26fb6e5f-afab-41a8-872e-50b58dadc0e8.png)
